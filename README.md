# Currency-Converter
This program uses an API to extract live data for accurate exchange rates.

This is also by far my most extensive code, primarily because I was entering entirely new territory.
Finding a viable and in my prefered case (free) API so I could run the code and ensure it worked as designed was difficult.
My chosen API extracted the rates formatted as a list which allowed me to use standard dictionary code after the API had gathered the data.

I got some more knowledge of dictionaries, APIs and how time consuming even small projects like this can be.
